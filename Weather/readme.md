# Weather App (Python Project)

A simple command-line weather application using the OpenWeatherMap API.  
I created this project to practice Python requests, JSON parsing, and user interaction.

# Features
- Fetch current weather for any city
- Shows temperature, feels like, humidity, wind speed, and condition
- Handles errors if the city is not found or network fails

# How to Run
1. Get a free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).
2. Open the folder in VS Code or any Python editor.
3. Run the script:
```bash
python weather_app.py
