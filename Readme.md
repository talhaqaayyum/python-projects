# Python Beginner Projects

This repository is a collection of small beginner-friendly Python projects I built while learning the language.  
Each project is in its own folder with a script and a short README explaining how it works.

The idea behind this repo is to **practice coding fundamentals**, explore different Python concepts, and have fun creating useful (and sometimes just fun) little programs.
