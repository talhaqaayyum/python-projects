# File Organizer (Python Project)

A simple Python program to organize files in a folder into subfolders based on file type.  
I built this project to practice Python file handling and automation.

# Features
- Organizes images, documents, audio, video, and archives
- Moves unknown file types to an "Others" folder
- Creates subfolders automatically if they donâ€™t exist
- Handles errors gracefully

# How to Use
1. Open the folder in VS Code or any Python editor.
2. Run the script:
```bash
python file_organizer.py
