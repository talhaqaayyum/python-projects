#  Number Guessing Game

A simple Python game where you try to guess the number that the computer picked.  
I created this project to practice Python basics like loops, conditionals, and user input.

# How to Play
1. The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
2. You enter your guesses one at a time.
3. The game tells you if your guess is too low, too high, or correct.
4. Try to guess the number in as few attempts as possible!

# How to Run
1. Open the folder in VS Code or any Python editor.
2. Run the script:
```bash
python guessing_game.py
