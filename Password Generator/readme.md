#  Password Generator

This is a simple Python program that creates a **strong random password** for you.  
I wrote this to practice Python basics and to have a handy tool for everyday use.

# How it Works
- The program asks you how long you want your password.
- It randomly mixes **letters**, **numbers**, and **symbols** to make it strong.
- It prints the password for you to use immediately.

# How to Run
1. Open the folder in VS Code or any Python editor.
2. Run the script:
```bash
python password_gen.py
